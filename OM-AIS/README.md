There is 3856 possible normal form AIS, 1928 prime form AIS and some invariant AIS 
(R-invariants and QI invariants).The operations avaiable are:
 -  retrogradation (R)
 - inversion (I)
 - retrograde inversion (RI) 
 - operation Q (Q)
 - multiplication (M)
 - inversion multiplication (IM)
 - retrograde Q (QR)
