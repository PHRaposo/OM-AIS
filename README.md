# OM-AIS

This is the AIS (All Interval Series) Library for Openmusic and OM#.

By Paulo Henrique Raposo, 2021.

This library was created to deal with calculations and manipulations of All-Interval Series.
There are 3856 possible normal form AIS, 1928 prime form AIS and some invariant AIS 
(R, QI and QRMI invariants).The operations avaiable are:
 -  retrogradation (R)
 - inversion (I)
 - retrograde inversion (RI) 
 - operation Q (Q)
 - multiplication (M)
 - inversion multiplication (IM)
 - retrograde Q (QR)
 - operation 0 - (0)
